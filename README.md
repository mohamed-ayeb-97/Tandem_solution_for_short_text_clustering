# Tandem Approach for Short Text Clustering

This repository implements a robust tandem approach for clustering short texts, leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By using sentence embeddings, dimensionality reduction, and clustering algorithms, this solution effectively groups semantically similar texts.

## Key Features

1. **Sentence Embeddings with HuggingFace Model**: We utilize the powerful `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model from Hugging Face's Sentence Transformers to generate high-quality sentence embeddings. This model provides rich representations of short text with its compact and efficient architecture.

2. **Dimensionality Reduction Techniques**:
   - **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Reduces dimensionality by projecting embeddings onto principal components while retaining as much variance as possible.
   - **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)**: Provides high-performance non-linear dimensionality reduction to enhance clustering results.

3. **Clustering Algorithms**:
   - **K-Means**: The classical and efficient k-means clustering algorithm, grouping points based on geometric proximity.
   - **K-Means++**: An optimized variant of k-means that initializes centroids to improve convergence speed and cluster quality.
   - **Spherical K-Means**: Clustering method that takes into account cosine similarity between embeddings, making it ideal for text data.

## Workflow

1. **Embedding Generation**: The text data is first passed through the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model to generate sentence embeddings.
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: We apply PCA or UMAP to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings, making clustering more efficient and effective.
3. **Clustering**: The reduced embeddings are then fed into one of the clustering algorithms (K-Means, K-Means++, or Spherical K-Means) to obtain clusters of semantically related texts.

## Applications

- Text clustering
- Intent detection
- Document grouping
- Topic modeling

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohamed-ayeb-97/Tandem_solution_for_short_text_clustering.git
